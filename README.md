# E-commerce-Product-Category-Classification
This is the classification based E-commerce text dataset for 4 categories - "Electronics", "Household", "Books" and "Clothing &amp; Accessories", which almost cover 80% of any E-commerce website..

# Overview
Utilizing a dataset sourced from Indian e-commerce platforms, this project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to automate product categorization. The dataset comprises 50,425 entries in CSV format, each containing a product description paired with its respective category label.

# Methodology
- Text Preprocessing: Implemented various normalization techniques, including case folding, punctuation removal, and lemmatization.

- Vectorization: Applied TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings to convert text data into numerical representations.

- Modeling: Evaluated multiple classifiers such as Navie Bayes Classifier.

- Performance: Achieved a validation accuracy of 94% using a tuned Navie Bayes Classifier model.

# Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand data distribution and class balance.

- Model Evaluation: Utilized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
